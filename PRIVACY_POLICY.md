# Privacy Policy – Robot Management System

## What Data Is Collected

The system collects usernames, user roles (Viewer/Commander), and timestamps of actions performed through the dashboard. When mission logging is enabled, each robot command is stored along with the issuing user and execution result. IP addresses are not stored.

## Why It Is Collected

This data is required to satisfy safety and accountability requirements of the Ground Control Station. Mission logs provide traceability in case of malfunction, misuse, or safety incidents.

## How It Is Secured

User passwords are hashed before storage. Access to mission logs is restricted via Role-Based Access Control. Data is stored locally within the application database and is not shared with third parties. Data retention is limited to the duration required for assessment demonstration purposes.
