## Dual Use and Ethical Implications

The Virtual Robot Management System is designed as a Ground Control Station for safe and structured navigation of an autonomous unit. However, such systems are inherently dual use. If an unauthorized actor gained Commander access, they could deliberately navigate the robot into obstacles, restricted zones, or unsafe operational areas. In a real warehouse environment, this could result in damaged infrastructure, financial loss, or even injury to personnel. A malicious actor could also repeatedly issue conflicting commands, causing operational disruption or draining the robot’s battery to render it unusable.

To mitigate these risks, the system enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that only authenticated users with the Commander role can issue movement commands. All commands are recorded in a persistent audit log with timestamps and user identifiers, enabling post-incident investigation and accountability. Obstacle validation prevents movement into blocked cells, and arrival confirmation logic ensures the robot’s state is continuously monitored. Network failure handling and timeout escalation reduce the risk of silent system failure. Together, these measures demonstrate a “defence-in-depth” approach, combining authentication, validation, monitoring, and traceability to reduce ethical and operational risks.
